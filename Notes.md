# Notes

## Goals:

- [ ] Proxy server setup for API calls to nodes.jup.io (see nodes.jup.io/test)
- [ ] get eslint:prod to error when a spec.ts or spec.tsx file will not compile (essentially, get cypress a tsconfig file that works)
- [ ] separate unit test coverage reports from cypress coverage reports, offer 'light' and 'dark' mode options also
