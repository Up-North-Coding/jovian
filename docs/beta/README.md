# Jovian Beta Release Docs

This codebase has been in the works since April 2022. The original wireframes were sketched out by Sigwo on the Jupiter team in early March 2022, and Nathan Bowers from the Up North Coding team started exploring putting together a bid for the user interface at that time.

The bid was submitted March 22, 2022 and code writing began in early April after a short design and specification review phase internally at Up North Coding.

The project was written by Nathan Bowers as the Project Manager and Primary Software Developer, and Vance Walsh who subcontracted on some of the work as a Senior Software Engineer. The project currently consists of about `13,500` lines of code.

It is built using the following software tools:

- React (Primary Frontend Framework)
- Vite (React Builder/Bundler)
- Typescript
- Material UI (Components Library)
- Cypres (Automated Testing)

Up North Coding is thrilled to present the project to the public in this limited beta phase. We are sure there are going to be some kinks to work out as there are with any major software project, but we're excited about winning the Jupiter Hackathon to bring this wallet to life and we look forward to ironing out any kinks as the wallet moves closer to the production ready frontend wallet for the project moving forward.

## Feedback Reporting

Nathan Bowers (@outragedhuman) will be monitoring the beta Discord channel and will be absorbing feedback. The initial stage of the beta will occur on the Jupiter Testnet so no funds will be at risk. While we don't anticipate any loss-of-funds based on the testing we've done so far, it's important to take a sane release process and that involves starting on testnet.

Three types of feedback will be managed:

1. Bugs - If a user finds a bug they should report it in the Discord wallet beta channel. If the bug is already known the user will be informed. If it's a new bug we will add it to the Github issue list and prioritize fixing it.
1. UI Feedback - Any UI suggestions should be reported in the Discord wallet beta channel. We will consider each of these and write Github issues on them and prioritize.
1. Security - Security suggestions should be DM'd to @outragedhuman so we can responsibly evaluate them. This allows us time to fix them before disclosing them publicly.
